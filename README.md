# Analysis-and-recommendation-of-movies

The rise of big data and advanced analytics has allowed companies such as Netflix, Youtube or Facebook to thrive by better matching the needs of their target groups. More generally, it has allowed scientists and researchers to use and recombine data at will to generate interesting insights and applications for a wide range of industries.
The goal of this project is to recommend a movie to users based on their preferred criteria. Our program allows users to choose a potential movie based on a wide range of factors such as average rating, number of rating, movie genre or date. To meet this purpose, we make use of two datasets provided by the movie recommendation service movie lens, which is affiliated to GroupLens Research, a research lab in the department of computer science and engineering at the University of Minnesota.

Before modification, the dataset originally contained, 100004 ratings and 1296 tag applications across 9125 movies. The data was generated by 671 users between January 09, 1995 and October 16, 2016 (Harper & Konstan, 2015).
Our two sub-datasets, “movies” and “ratings” are made of 3 (movieid, title (containing title and date), genres) and 4 columns respectively (userid, movieid, rating, timestamp).
